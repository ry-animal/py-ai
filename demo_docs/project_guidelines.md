# Software Development Guidelines

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
We follow a feature branch workflow:
1. Create feature branches from `main`
2. Use descriptive commit messages
3. Open pull requests for code review
4. Require 2 approvals before merging
5. Delete feature branches after merging

### Code Review Process
- All code must be reviewed by at least 2 team members
- Reviews should focus on functionality, security, and maintainability
- Use our PR template for consistent documentation
- Address all feedback before merging

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests required for all new features
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for high-traffic features

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication

- Rotate API keys quarterly

### Data Protection
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Follow GDPR and CCPA compliance requirements
- Implement proper access controls and audit logging

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use security scanning tools in CI/CD
- Review third-party packages before adoption

## Release Process

### Versioning
We use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features, backward compatible
- PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Feature development and testing
2. Staging deployment for QA testing
3. Production deployment during maintenance windows
4. Post-deployment monitoring and rollback procedures

### Documentation
- Update API documentation with each release
- Maintain changelog with all notable changes
- Update user guides for UI changes

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. Identify and assess the issue severity
2. Notify the on-call engineer and team lead
3. Create incident channel in Slack
4. Document all actions taken
5. Conduct post-incident review
